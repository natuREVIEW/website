The device is capable of motion detection and can stream both online and offline video over WiFi to visitors who pass by the device.<br><br>As an open-source project, this means that the code and design for the device will be made publicly available for others to use, modify, and build upon. This allows for greater collaboration and innovation within the community.<br><br>Some potential applications of this device could include monitoring wildlife activity in natural habitats, capturing footage of environmental changes over time, or providing educational resources for visitors to learn more about the natural world around them.</p>
